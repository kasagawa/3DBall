# Season’s Greetings
  *A fast-paced Player vs game game that creates excitement because of the changing holidays and cool game mechanics.*

##Game Overview 

###Concept: 
To develop a game that is different every time it’s played in order to keep the player engaged and excited for what’s next. Show our strengths in design aesthetic and story and theme conceptualization to develop a more interesting version of the ball rolling game, while significantly improving it. Create a short play game that keeps the player interested while traveling on the metro or waiting for the wifi to load.
###Genre: 
Action-Platform game
###Target Audience: 
Young people between the ages of 10-35 that are looking for a fast paced game to play on the train or any mode of public transportation on their way to work or school (or while waiting for their friends).
###Look and Feel: 
The game is deeply rooted on the design aesthetic and vision of its creators. There are different color schemes on every level with a specific conceptualized theme for each one. Every level is packed with graphics, which makes the game very appealing to the eye. Even though the game has an automated forward movement (see below) you can still win the game, which increases the expectations.
###Mood/Emotion: 
This game is supposed to make the player happy and put them in the holiday spirit! It will also be frustrating as you fall off the platform while trying to collect a tricky object.


##The Game
The purpose of the game is to engage the player in a fast-paced game of skill and fun. We are attempting to develop a world that would keep the player engaged at each level by making the game themed.
Game Progression: There are three levels that get harder by introducing new game mechanics as the levels progress. When a level changes, the game starts spawning the new platforms (see below) onto the path with the new design, as well as the new mechanics.
###Goal: 
The goal of the game is to collect the right amount of collectible objects in each level. Each level’s objects will change and in the last level there are at least 4 different objects and stars to be collected in order to win the game. 
Mission:  To collect enough collectables objects per level.
Objectives: To keep the player engaged with interesting graphics and exciting game mechanics.
###Game Flow: 
There is a single path that the ball will be rolling through and as the game progresses the platforms will be changing, as well as the color of the ball to create an aesthetic for the level.
Flaws: There is a bit of a lag when the scenes try to load.


##Game Mechanics 
- The game consists of a progressive path that changes as the game progresses and the levels change. The game is inspired by the combination of endless path games, games that involve object collection, and the basic ball rolling game. 
- The ball has an automated forward movement functionality, which makes the game constantly action packed and allows for the player to be engaged. The path is very short and the platforms keep disappearing in the back and appearing in front periodically, which keeps the goal of making the game fast paced.

###Controls
* Left and Right arrow keys to move side to side in the top planes
* Up and Down arrow keys to move up and down in the left planes 
* Space key to jump (only in level 3)
* Automatic forward movement

###Scoring
- The game makes use of a different progress bar (per level) that keeps track of the amount of objects collected at each level. Considering the amount of objects that needs to be collected at each level to be n, the progress breakdown would be as follows: 
  - For level 1, you need to collect n easter eggs in order to move on to level 2.
  - For level 2, you need to collect n Jack O’Lanterns in order to move on to level 3.
  - For level 3, you need to collect n/k of each of the christmas collectables that appear (where k is the number of different christmas collectables) and i stars (where i is the set number of stars needed -- usually i = 3)

##Story
*This game is not dependant on story, but rather on game mechanics and graphics.*

The game involves a color-changing ball the progressively moves through different seasonal holidays (i.e. Easter, Halloween, Christmas).
Each level contains holiday specific objects: easter eggs on Easter, Jack O’Lanterns on Halloween, and candy canes, teddy bears, ornaments, and presents on Christmas.

##Interface
###Progress bars: 
The progress bars at the top of the screen implicitly teach the player about the purpose of the game. In between levels, the colors change and they reset. More importantly, the image to the left of it changes, altering the player that they now need to collect a new object. In level 3, there are four progress bars, one for each object you need to collect.

###Stars: 
In level 3, you now have to jump to collect stars. There are three greyed-out stars in the far right, which light up after you collect a star and show how many more you need. 

###Text: 
####Timer: 
This keeps track of the time in the upper right. If you win, your final time will be displayed in the winning scene.
On your mark/You lose: This text appears in the center of the screen to keep the player updated on the status of the game.
JumpText: After you finish level 2, text pops up in the center of the screen, altering the player that he can now jump.
####Music: 
The holiday-appropriate music transitions between the levels as one other way of telling the player that the level has changed.
